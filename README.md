## Finding Elements Greater Than Their Left Neighbor
**Objective**: Write a Python script to identify and print all elements in a list that are greater than the element immediately preceding them.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a list of numbers as input.

**Comparison**
- For each element in the list (except the first one), compare it to the element immediately to its left.
- If the current element is greater than its left neighbor, it should be added to a new list that will be printed.

**Output**
- Print all elements that are greater than their left neighbor.

**Example**
- For input [3, 5, 2, 4, 6], the output should be 5 4 6.
- For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be 2 3 4 5.

## Counting Distinct Elements in a Sorted List
**Objective**: Write a Python script to determine and print the number of distinct elements in a list of numbers that are sorted in ascending order.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a list of numbers, with all elements sorted in ascending order.

**Counting Distinct Elements**
- Identify the number of distinct elements in the list.

**Output**
- Print the number of distinct elements in the list.

**Example**
- For input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], the output should be 4.
- For input [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], the output should be 1.

## Swapping Adjacent Elements in a List
**Objective**: Write a Python script to swap adjacent elements in pairs within a given list of numbers. If the list has an odd number of elements, leave the last element unchanged.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a list of numbers as input.

**Element Swapping**
- Swap each pair of adjacent elements (e.g., swap the first element with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on).
- If the list has an odd number of elements, the last element should remain in its original position.

**Output**
- Print the resulting list after the swaps.

**Example**
- For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the output should be [2, 1, 4, 3, 5].
- For input [10, 20, 30, 40], the output should be [20, 10, 40, 30].

## Swapping the Minimum and Maximum Elements in a List
**Objective**: Write a Python script to identify the minimum and maximum elements in a list of distinct numbers, swap their positions, and print the resulting list.

### Instructions:
**Input Collection**
- The program will receive a list of distinct numbers as input.

**Element Swapping**
- Identify the minimum and maximum elements in the list.
- Swap the positions of the minimum and maximum elements.

**Output**
- Print the resulting list after the swap!

**Example**
- For input [3, 8, 1, 7, 5], the output should be [3, 1, 8, 7, 5].
- For input [10, 2, 9, 4, 7], the output should be [10, 9, 2, 4, 7].
